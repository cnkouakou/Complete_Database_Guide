## 💡 Why this book?

Many resources focus only on SQL syntax or purely on theory, often leaving readers unsure of how to design effective, real-world databases. This book combines clear theoretical explanations with practical scripts, diagrams, and case studies — helping you not only learn but also confidently apply what you learn.
